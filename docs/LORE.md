# üìñ GangGPT Lore Documentation

Welcome to the dark, AI-infused streets of Los Santos, where artificial
intelligence has fundamentally changed the nature of crime, power, and survival.

## üåÜ World Setting

### The Year: 2025

Los Santos has evolved into a techno-urban sprawl where traditional criminal
hierarchies compete with AI-enhanced organizations. The city exists in a state
of controlled chaos, where every citizen's data is tracked, every conversation
is potentially monitored, and every criminal organization must adapt to survive
in an age of digital omnipresence.

### The AI Revolution

In 2024, a breakthrough in artificial intelligence accessibility led to the
democratization of advanced AI systems. What began as productivity tools quickly
evolved into something far more sinister. Criminal organizations, government
agencies, and corporations now employ AI advisors that can predict, plan, and
execute complex strategies with unprecedented efficiency.

## üèôÔ∏è Districts of Los Santos

### Downtown Core

**The Digital Heart** The gleaming towers of LifeInvader, Maze Bank, and other
corporate giants dominate the skyline. Here, data is the most valuable
commodity, and information brokers operate in the shadows of legitimate
business. Corporate executives make deals that can topple governments, while
cybercriminals hack into systems that control the city's infrastructure.

**Key Locations:**

- LifeInvader Headquarters: The nerve center of the city's digital surveillance
- Maze Bank Tower: Where legitimate and illegitimate money flows intersect
- The Grid: Underground data center for independent hackers
- Federal Plaza: Government agencies and their AI advisors

### East Los Santos

**The Forgotten Neighborhoods** While downtown gleams with neon and glass, East
LS remains a testament to urban decay. Here, traditional gangs struggle to
maintain relevance in an AI-dominated world. Some have embraced technology,
using drones and predictive algorithms to enhance their operations. Others cling
to old-school methods, becoming increasingly marginalized.

**Key Locations:**

- The Compound: Los Santos Cartel's fortified headquarters
- Scrapyard Networks: Where stolen vehicles become untraceable assets
- Underground Clinics: Medical services for those who can't afford official
  healthcare
- The Bunker: Secret meeting place for anti-AI resistance

### Vinewood Hills

**The Privileged Heights** The wealthy elite live in smart homes protected by AI
security systems and private armies. Here, the city's power brokers make
decisions that affect millions. Corporate executives, corrupt politicians, and
crime bosses maintain an uneasy balance of power through a complex web of
alliances and mutual blackmail.

**Key Locations:**

- Luxury Safe Houses: Where high-profile meetings occur away from surveillance
- Private Airfields: For quick escapes and discrete arrivals
- The Observatory: Neutral ground for faction negotiations
- Hidden Server Farms: Where the wealthy store their most sensitive data

### Port Area

**The Gateway** Los Santos Port remains the entry point for everything the city
craves: drugs, weapons, exotic cars, and illegal immigrants. The port is
controlled by a shifting alliance of criminal organizations, each using AI to
optimize their smuggling operations and stay ahead of law enforcement.

**Key Locations:**

- Container Terminal: Where most illegal goods enter the city
- Warehouse District: Storage and distribution center for criminal enterprises
- The Docks: Traditional smuggling routes now enhanced with drone surveillance
- Port Authority: Government oversight compromised by corruption

### Sandy Shores

**The Badlands** Beyond the city limits, Sandy Shores has become a haven for
those who reject the AI-monitored city life. The Nomads have established a
network of off-grid communities, while government agencies conduct secret AI
experiments away from public scrutiny.

**Key Locations:**

- The Farm: Off-grid compound for the Nomads
- Research Facility: Government AI development center
- Desert Airstrip: For clandestine flights and drone testing
- Ghost Towns: Abandoned settlements now used as meeting points
