- [x] Database connected
- [x] AI services configured
- [x] RAGE:MP client installed
- [x] GTA V available

## üöÄ Next Steps for Live Testing

### 1. Download RAGE:MP Server (if not already done)
```powershell
# Download RAGE:MP server from https://rage.mp/
# Extract to a folder (e.g., C:\RageMP-Server\)
```

### 2. Setup GangGPT Server Configuration
```powershell
# Copy the project conf.json to your RAGE:MP server directory
# The conf.json is already configured for:
# - Port: 22005
# - Max Players: 1000
# - Name: "GangGPT - AI-Powered Roleplay Server"
# - NodeJS module enabled
```

### 3. Copy GangGPT Package to Server
```powershell
# Copy packages/ganggpt/ to [RAGEMP-SERVER]/packages/ganggpt/
# Copy client_packages/ to [RAGEMP-SERVER]/client_packages/
```

### 4. Build and Deploy Backend Integration
```powershell
# Ensure the backend is built
npm run build

# The packages/ganggpt/index.js loads dist/index.js
# This integrates our TypeScript backend with RAGE:MP
```
