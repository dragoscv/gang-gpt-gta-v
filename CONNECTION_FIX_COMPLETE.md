# ðŸŽ® GangGPT - Connection Issues FIXED & Ready to Launch! 

**UPDATE**: All connection issues have been resolved and the game is now fully operational!

## âœ… Final Problems Resolved (June 8, 2025)

### 1. RAGE:MP Updater Connection Issue
**Problem**: Updater arguments `--connect localhost:22005 --skip-launcher-update` were not working
**Solution**: Updated to use proper RAGE:MP protocol: `ragemp://localhost:22005/`

### 2. Server Connection Timeouts  
**Problem**: Clients were getting "connection lost" due to strict timeout settings
**Solution**: 
- Increased timeout from 15s to 30s
- Increased connection-timeout from 60s to 120s  
- Increased max-ping from 500ms to 1000ms

### 3. Automated Game Launch
**Problem**: No reliable way to launch game from browser
**Solution**: Created comprehensive launcher system with multiple options

## ðŸš€ How to Launch the Game NOW

### Option 1: Browser Launch (Recommended)
1. Open browser to: http://localhost:4829
2. Click the "LAUNCH GAME" button
3. Game will auto-launch and connect

### Option 2: Manual Launch Scripts
- **Windows**: Double-click `launch-ganggpt-game.bat`
- **PowerShell**: Run `launch-ganggpt-game.ps1`

### Option 3: Development Tasks
Use VS Code tasks:
- "GangGPT: Start All Services" - Starts everything
- "GangGPT: Check Services Status" - Verify all running

## ðŸ”§ Current Service Status (VERIFIED WORKING)

All services are running and verified:
