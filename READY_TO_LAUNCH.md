- **Package errors**: Ensure packages/ganggpt directory copied correctly

### Quick Diagnostics:
```powershell
# Check backend health
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:4828/health

# Check server processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*rage*"}

# Check server ports
netstat -ano | findstr 22005
```
