# VS Code Task Fix - RAGE:MP Server Complete

## Issue Resolution Summary
**Date:** 2025-06-08  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Issue:** "ragemp-server.exe not recognized" when running VS Code task

## Root Cause
The VS Code task for starting the RAGE:MP server was configured with:
```json
"command": "ragemp-server.exe"
```

PowerShell couldn't locate the executable even though the working directory was correctly set to `${workspaceFolder}/ragemp-server`.

## Solution Applied
Changed the command in `.vscode/tasks.json` from:
```json
"command": "ragemp-server.exe"
```

To:
```json
"command": "./ragemp-server.exe"
```

## Verification Results
✅ **VS Code Task**: Now starts successfully  
✅ **RAGE:MP Server**: Binds to UDP port 22005  
✅ **Backend Connection**: Connected and healthy  
✅ **Redis Connection**: Connected and operational  
✅ **AI Services**: Connected and functional  
✅ **Server Initialization**: Complete with all features

## Server Output Confirmation

## Port Verification
