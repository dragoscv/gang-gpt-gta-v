# Statistics Component Fixes and Test Implementation

## What does this PR do?

This PR fixes critical issues in the statistics component, improves the tRPC client implementation, enhances Redis connection handling, and adds comprehensive test coverage to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.

## Why is it needed?

The statistics component was experiencing several critical issues:
- React hydration errors due to server/client time differences
- Incorrect API URL construction leading to failed API calls
- Missing error handling causing silent failures
- Redis connection timeouts without proper fallbacks
- Lack of test coverage for both frontend and backend functionality

These issues were causing the statistics section to fail, preventing users from seeing important server metrics.

## How was it tested?

The implementation was thoroughly tested using multiple approaches:

- **Unit Tests**: Added Jest tests for the API client and statistics component
  - API Client: URL resolution, environment configuration, error handling
  - Statistics Component: Rendering, data formatting, edge cases

- **E2E Tests**: Created Playwright tests for complete frontend-backend integration
  - Display of real-time statistics data
  - Real-time updates and data refresh
  - Proper error handling and loading states
  - Responsive design on mobile devices

- **Manual Testing**: Verified in browser that:
  - Statistics load correctly with real data
  - Error handling works as expected
  - UI is responsive and accessible

All tests are now passing with 100% success rate.
